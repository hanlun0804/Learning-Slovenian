# Learning Slovenian

Zdravo! This repo showcases my journey learning Slovenian. Why am I learning this difficult language you might ask? My partner and his family Slovenian, and I don't want my future kids to be able to talk about me behind my back. 

Here are some fun facts about the Slovenian language: 

- Slovenian has a dual form, not only singular and plural like basically every other language.
- Slovenia has 2 million people, and still 40 distinct dialects. These vary so much, that Slovenians are not always able to understand each other.
- Slovenian has 6 *skloni*, or casess. This increases the complexity, and accuracy, of the language.

Regularly pushing to GitHub is something that has kept me accountable in the past, so I am hoping it does so this time as well, and I am planning on practicing every day. Wish me luck as I embark on this journey
