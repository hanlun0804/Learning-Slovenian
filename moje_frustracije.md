# Moje frustracije

This is the page I will rant about all my frustrations with this language. I don't know what to expect of this page, but it will be in English, and it will have ranting.

## The keyboard

Very simple frustration, and understandable that it is how it is, but the keys are different places on the keyboard. Most notingly, y and z are swapped, which I mistype every, single, time! čšž are also in place of øå', and ' is in place of +. This is very frusterating when writing.

## ČŠŽ

Look, I get that every alphabet has different letters. And Norwegian has their skj. sj, kj sounds, which aren't much simpler. But these are so difficult to differentiate!

## The word "lahko"

Does it mean easy? Light? Can? May? Or are you saying good night? Nobody knows! You have to figure it out, based on the other words! 

## Figure it out

This brings me perfectly to my next point. Slovenian pretty much always seems to be a "just know it/just figure it out" language. Oh, this word? Yes, it means this. But oh no, it has this other word in the sentence. Then it means that! How am I supposed to know!
